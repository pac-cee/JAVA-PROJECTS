# DockerDeployment Project

This project demonstrates how to containerize a Java backend application using Docker.

## Business Logic / Explanation

- **Dockerfile:**
  - Defines how to build a Docker image for a Java application (e.g., a Spring Boot JAR).
  - Uses an official OpenJDK image, copies the JAR, and runs it.
- **How it works:**
  - You build the Docker image and run it as a container. The app is accessible on the exposed port.

## How to Run
1. Build your Java application (e.g., Spring Boot) and produce a JAR file (e.g., `app.jar`).
2. Place the JAR and Dockerfile in this directory.
3. Example Dockerfile:
   ```Dockerfile
   FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine
   COPY app.jar app.jar
   ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
   EXPOSE 8080
   ```
4. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t java-backend-app .
   ```
5. Run the Docker container:
   ```
   docker run -p 8080:8080 java-backend-app
   ```
6. Access your app at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

This example is the foundation for deploying Java backend services in modern cloud environments.
