# CollectionsDemo Project

This project demonstrates the use of Java's core collections: List, Set, and Map.

## Business Logic / Explanation

- **List**: Ordered collection that allows duplicates. We add fruits to a List, including a duplicate.
- **Set**: Unordered collection that does not allow duplicates. We convert the List to a Set to remove duplicates.
- **Map**: Collection of key-value pairs. We count the occurrences of each fruit in the List using a Map.

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal in this directory.
2. Compile the program:
   ```
   javac CollectionsDemo.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```
   java CollectionsDemo
   ```

Expected output:
```
List: [Apple, Banana, Apple]
Set: [Banana, Apple]
Map: {Apple=2, Banana=1}
```
