# HelloWorld Project

This is your very first Java project. The goal is to understand the basic structure of a Java program and how to print output to the console.

## Business Logic / Explanation

- **Class Declaration:**
  - `public class HelloWorld` declares a public class named `HelloWorld`.
- **Main Method:**
  - `public static void main(String[] args)` is the entry point of any Java application. The JVM looks for this method to start execution.
- **Printing Output:**
  - `System.out.println("Hello, World!");` prints the text `Hello, World!` to the console.

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal in this directory.
2. Compile the program:
   ```
   javac HelloWorld.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```
   java HelloWorld
   ```

You should see the output:
```
Hello, World!
```
