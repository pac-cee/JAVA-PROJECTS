# Java Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of Java projects that I have built to explore and demonstrate various concepts, frameworks, and tools in Java development. The projects are organized into different levels of complexity and domains, showcasing a wide range of use cases.

## Project Structure

### Beginner
- **Library Management System**: A simple application to manage books, users, and lending records using Spring Boot and JPA.
- **Task Manager**: A task management application with CRUD operations and data seeding for demonstration purposes.

### Intermediate
- **E-commerce Platform**: A comprehensive e-commerce application featuring product management, order processing, and integration with RabbitMQ, Redis, and Swagger for API documentation.

### Advanced
- **Cloud Platform**: A cloud-based event streaming service using Kafka and Spring Cloud Stream for real-time data processing.
- **Trading Engine**: A high-performance trading engine for simulating financial transactions and order matching.

## Key Features
- **Spring Boot**: Most projects leverage Spring Boot for rapid development and dependency injection.
- **Database Integration**: Projects use JPA/Hibernate for database operations.
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ and Kafka are used for asynchronous communication in intermediate and advanced projects.
- **Caching**: Redis is integrated for caching frequently accessed data.
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI is used for documenting RESTful APIs.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests are included in some projects to ensure code quality.

## How to Run
Each project has its own `README.md` or documentation file with instructions on how to set up and run the application. Most projects use Maven for dependency management and build automation.

## Future Plans
- Add more advanced projects, such as a microservices architecture with service discovery and load balancing.
- Explore other Java frameworks like Quarkus and Micronaut.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

Feel free to explore the projects and provide feedback or suggestions!
